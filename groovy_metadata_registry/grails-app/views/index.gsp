					<!-- <p>Pinpointing the data we need can be like looking for a needle in a haystack.
					</br></br>
					At MDC we are committed to providing organisations with an effective data strategy so they can find the data they want, when they want.</br>
					A metadata registry is an essential part of that strategy because it provides organisations with:
						<ul>
						<li>a centralized repository that allows users to discover intra and extra organisational data structured within a particular domain;</li> 
						<li>an area where engineers can quickly access information about systems or data sets and facilitate integration between them;</li>
						<li>existing data models, that allow architects to make informed decisions rather than 
						constantly re-invent the wheel;</li>
						 <li> and the ability for researchers to interogate independent data sets and treat them 
						as a cohesive whole</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
