/**
  Major layout components, such as header and footer.

  ** Taken from http://smacss.com/book/type-layout **

  Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally
  styled using ID selectors but take the time to think about the
  elements that are common across all components of the page and
  use class selectors where appropriate.
