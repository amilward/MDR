/**
  Default theme.
  ** Taken from http://smacss.com/book/type-theme **
  It is probably self-evident but a theme defines colours and 
  images that give your application or site its look and feel. 
  Separating the theme out into its own set of styles allows 
  for those styles to be easily redefined for alternate themes.

  Themes can affect any of the primary types. It could override 
  base styles like default link colours. It could change module 
  elements such as chrome colours and borders. It could affect 
  layout with different arrangements. It could also alter how 
  states look.
